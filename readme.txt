I am a recently graduated web developer with a strong background in modern web technologies and practical experience gained during my internship at a renowned IT consulting firm. 

During my time at the consultancy, I worked on real projects where I collaborated with multidisciplinary teams to develop efficient and functional solutions. I specialise in Wordpress, Prestashop, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and frameworks such as Laravel. In addition, I have knowledge in backend using Spring Boot and SQL databases. 

I am passionate about creating intuitive and accessible web applications, and I am always looking to learn and improve my skills. I am ready to contribute my energy and knowledge to new challenges in the world of web development.
